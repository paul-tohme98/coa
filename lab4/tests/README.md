At first please make sure that all scripts found in this directory are to be executed from the directory "lab4/tests/" only, otherwise you will have problems concerning the path of "src/driver/dtiger".

Second, please ignore the "tests" directory in the folder "lab4/dragon-tiger/" and use the one directly in "lab4/"

In this directory you will find two bash scripts : 

The first one is run.sh :
usage : ./run.sh filename
Note that the files should be tiger files (.tig) otherwise it will not execute coorectly
This script will show you the llvm result of the tiger file in question and store the output in a file named : filename.tig.ll

The second one is run_rec.sh
usage : ./run_rec.sh directory
This script will execute : src/driver/dtiger -i --dump-ir "file" , for all the files present in the directory passed by the user in argument, and it will automatically store the results in .ll files , for each file.tig there will be a file.tig.ll that contains the corresponding llvm code.
Note that if the directory is not passed or is not found, the script exits without doing anything

You can find the .ll files generated by me as a test in the directory called "demo"
